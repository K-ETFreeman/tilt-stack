This particular fork is made just as temporary solution for testing veto system. 
Current workflow: 
1. Launch kubernetes (reset cluster if needed; can be needed to not cause issues with id-duplicates errors in populate database)
2. Disable api, ice breaker and traefik deployment in tilt (they mess up with api launching locally)
3. Launch my api fork locally
4. [Optional] adjust mappools using my fork of mod-client and test:test user
5. Launch my client fork locally, (twice), using test:test and test2:test2 users
6. Adjust vetoes, launch matchmaker, see how everything works

# Tilt Stack
This repository aims to provide a ready-to-go [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/) setup for ephemeral FAF infrastructure local development on kubernetes.

## Structure
The tilt stack uses kubernetes resources in /deploy to define all the faf resources. The service definitions are simplifications of those used in the [gitops-stack](https://github.com/FAForever/gitops-stack). A majority of the environment configuration and proxying is removed as the tilt stack is intended to be used for local development only and all services are meant to be accessed directly via localhost. All services should have their oeprational ports exposed via port-forwarding.

## Configuration
The tilt stack is designed to require as little configuration as possible. Sane and consistent defaults have been defined for all the services.

## Data
The tilt stack is currently intended to be used transiently so there is no local storage. All the data and resources are created and destroyed with their containers.

# Usage
## Prerequisites
* [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
* Kuberenetes ([Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) is recommended for those new to kubernetes) (Tilt cluster setup)[https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters]
* For windows users a bash program. By default git bash is used with an assumed installation directory of C:/Program Files/Git

## Startup Services
In the root directoy of your repository run `tilt up`. This will start all the faf services in the correct order. The status of each service can be viewed in the tilt UI by visiting http://localhost:10350. This is the control server for tilt where you can restart services or disable them for substitution by services you would like to run from source code as you actively develop them.

## Development
To develop against the FAF infrastructure you should disable the service in tilt that you are actively developing. Once disabled you can start up your developed version. Some tweaks may need to be made to the default configuration parameters in the source code. The proper values can be found in the configMaps in each of the services kubernetes deploy yaml files.

## Test Data
The default test data that is loaded can be found in /sql/test-data.sql. This can be overridden by providing a new path with the tilt configuration key test-data-path when running tilt up or in the tilt_config.json file in the repository root directory.
